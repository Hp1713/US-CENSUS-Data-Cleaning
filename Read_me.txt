Cleaning US Census Data

Collect census data and create visualizations and insights from it.
Data is in multiple csv files. 
Data obtained without use pandas, looked through these csv files manually whenever they wanted to find something. 
Sometimes they would copy and paste certain numbers into Excel to make charts.
This is not scalable or repeatable.

Task is to make this data readable and scalable using pandas, matplotlib and numpy.

Make some scatterplots and histograms 
Get data into pandas and into reasonable shape so that you can make these histograms
